# Tinker-CAD---Motion-Detector
So satisfying to watch the logic come alive in Tinkercad—every wire, gate, and component snapping into place. There  is this quiet excitement when the simulation runs and you can see the idea actually work, not just imagine it.

This Tinkercad model simulates an object motion detector using electronic components and logical control.

It provides a clear, visual understanding of how motion detection works, making sensor-based systems easy and engaging for beginners to learn.
